"""
Main Snakemake workflow for tenk10k-causal-paper project.

This workflow orchestrates GWAS, gene annotation, enrichment, scDRS, OTP, and correlation analyses using modular rule files.

Included rule files:
	- init.smk: Initialization and gene annotation
	- otp.smk: Open Targets Platform drug/disease association processing
	- smr.smk: Summary-based Mendelian Randomization analysis
	- magma.smk: MAGMA gene-level association and aggregation
	- enrichment.smk: Gene set enrichment analysis
	- format_gwas.smk: GWAS summary statistics formatting
	- scdrs.smk: Single-cell disease relevance score analysis
	- gen_cor.smk: Genetic correlation analysis (not curently used)

Main dependencies:
	- Python (pandas, yaml, pathlib)
	- R (data.table, dplyr, stringr, etc.)
	- MAGMA, LDAK, scDRS, Enrichr, gget

Inputs, outputs, and parameters are defined in each rule file. See individual rule files for details.
