# 4-drug: Drug Target Support Analysis

This directory contains scripts for analyzing existing evidence of clinical development for causal genes identified through Mendelian Randomization analyses using data from [Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/).

## Overview

This section performs drug target enrichment analyses to identify whether genes with causal effects on disease traits are enriched for known drug targets. 

## Contents

### Scripts
- `drug_enrichment_main.R` - Main drug enrichment analysis script that:
  - Analyzes enrichment of drug targets among causal genes
  - Compares different categories of drug targets
  - Creates visualizations for drug target enrichment results
  - Generates statistical summaries for manuscript
